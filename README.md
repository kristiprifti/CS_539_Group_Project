Hello!

Welcome to our WPI CS-539 Project Repo!

Our team has worked to construct a machine-learning application that helps users evaluate McDonalds franchises.

Our code can be found here: https://github.com/WillGodsey/CS_539_Group_Project

Our website is here https://cs539-project.streamlit.app/

In order to use our code you will need a python environment, and to install the following libraries:
1. Streamlit
2. Numpy
3. Pydeck
4. streamlit_searchbox
5. pands
6. SciKit Learn
7. nltk
8. ast
9. spacy
10. time
11. spellchecker
12. collections
13. re

To use our code you will also need to ensure that you have also downloaded the necessary assets from the repository.

Now that you've dowloaded everything you'll need, just enter steamlit run index.py into your terminal. 
From here you'll be able to make use of the team's application, as well as learn more about the team's motivation, process, the technology that we 
used, as well as our thoughts on the current product, and areas of possible future work.
